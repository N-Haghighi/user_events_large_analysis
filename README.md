User Behavioral Analysis on Messaging Application Data
Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory behavioral analysis of user interaction data from a simulated messaging application. The objective was to extract actionable insights from event-level data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The analysis focuses on user engagement patterns, temporal behavior, activity concentration, and retention metrics.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 1,500 user-generated events across a 15-day period.

Columns:

user_id — Unique identifier of the user

event_type — Type of event (message_sent, login)

event_time — Timestamp of event occurrence

device — Platform used (android, ios)

city — User city

Dataset Characteristics:

100 unique users

1500 total events

Multi-device usage

Multi-city distribution

Simulated behavioral patterns

Data Preparation

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Converted event_time to datetime format

Sorted data chronologically

Extracted derived features:

Hour of activity

Date

Day name

Aggregated user-level and time-level metrics

Key Metrics (KPIs)
1. Total Events

1500

2. Unique Users

100

3. Active User Ratio

Users with ≥10 events:

92%

This indicates high engagement across the majority of users.

4. Activity Concentration

Share of total events generated by active users:

95.8%

This suggests that highly engaged users contribute most of the platform activity.

Temporal Behavior Analysis
Peak Activity Hour

08:00 AM

Users show highest interaction during early morning hours, likely aligning with workday start behavior.

Daily Trend

Activity distribution across 15 days shows relatively stable engagement without significant drop-offs.

Device Analysis

Event Distribution:

Android: 1047 events (~70%)

iOS: 453 events (~30%)

The distribution aligns with simulated platform penetration and does not show significant behavioral divergence.

Geographic Distribution

User activity is relatively balanced across:

Tehran

Shiraz

Mashhad

Tabriz

Isfahan

No dominant geographic skew detected.

User Activity Distribution

User-level event distribution appears approximately symmetric, centered around 14–16 events per user.

No extreme heavy-tail behavior observed.

This indicates relatively balanced participation across the user base.

Retention Analysis
Average Active Days per User

9.51 days (out of 15)

Users were active on approximately 63% of the observed period.

Retention Rate (Users active on more than one day)

100%

Since this dataset is simulated, churn behavior is minimal. In a real-world scenario, lower retention and observable drop-off patterns would be expected.

This highlights the importance of evaluating data realism when interpreting engagement metrics.

Business Insights

Engagement is strong and broadly distributed across users.

Activity is concentrated among highly engaged users.

Early morning engagement suggests optimal timing for notifications.

No significant device or city imbalance detected.

Retention appears unrealistically high due to dataset simulation, indicating absence of churn behavior.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Perform structured behavioral data analysis

Define and calculate meaningful KPIs

Interpret engagement and retention metrics

Evaluate dataset realism

Translate data findings into business-level insights

The analysis reflects applied data reasoning rather than purely technical computation.
