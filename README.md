# User Behavioral Analysis  
### Messaging Application Event Data (Python | Pandas)

---

## Overview

This project presents an exploratory behavioral analysis of event-level interaction data from a simulated messaging application.

The objective was to transform raw user activity logs into structured engagement insights using a reproducible Python-based data processing workflow.

---

## Dataset Summary

- 1,500 total events  
- 100 unique users  
- 15-day observation window  
- Event types: `login`, `message_sent`  
- Platforms: Android, iOS  
- Multi-city distribution  

---

## Analytical Focus

The analysis covers:

- Engagement concentration  
- Active user segmentation  
- Temporal usage patterns  
- Platform distribution  
- Retention evaluation  
- KPI-driven behavioral insights  

---

## Key Insights

### Engagement Metrics

- 92% of users classified as active (≥10 events)
- 95.8% of total activity generated by highly active users
- Average active days per user: 9.51 / 15

### Temporal Behavior

- Peak activity hour: 08:00 AM  
- Stable engagement trend across the observation window  

### Retention

Retention was measured as the proportion of users active on more than one day.

- Retention Rate: 100%  
- High user consistency observed across the dataset  

*Note: Since the dataset is simulated, churn behavior is minimal.*
